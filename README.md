# Wargame-of-cards

**Working of Game:**
1. After the even ditribution of cards, round 1 will start where the priority of the card thrown by each of the two players is checked.
2. In case, the priority of both the cards thrown by each player is same, then it is a "War".
3. If any of the player is not having atleast 5 cards to play in further rounds, that player will loose the game.
4. If both the players have more than 5 cards, then the "War" will continue.
